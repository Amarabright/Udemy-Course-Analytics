# Udemy-Course-Analytics
This is the Analysis of courses taken by students in Udemy from 2011 to 2017.


## **Project Description:**

What is the need for being in business and having a company when you can’t track your business performance to know where the gold of your business resides? How will you know your customer’s need in order to serve them appropriately?

This was the situation of the Education tech company-Udemy who wants data-driven insights into their business. The company presented the data on course revenue showing different data on the different courses and topics to understand where opportunities abound and then track the performance of courses.

To determine where the gold lies, data sheets/spreadsheets for four subjects (Business Courses, Design Courses, Web Development and Music courses) were provided. Each spreadsheet contains Course iD, course title, URL, price, number of Subscribers, number of reviews, number of lectures, level, rating and time (duration) they took the course.

The period under review is 9th July, 2011 to 6th July, 2017

## **The problem**
Considering the available data, Certain questions are to be answered, such as?

* How to generate revenue from sales of courses
* How to track course performance
* What course has the highest sale?
* what course has the lowest sale?
* What determines the purchase rate of courses?

## **The Design**
In order to get meaningful insights from the data, It needed to be cleaned and made ready for analysis. The essence of thorough cleaning and evaluation of the data sets is to ensure that our data has quality, is accurate, complete, consistent, unique, valid, unique, current and relevant to our analysis. The steps taken to clean the data and prepare for analysis are:

* Consolidation of data
* Reformatting of cells
* Deleting duplicate columns
* Removing blank cells, removing headers
* Right/left function: to change the published time format into appropriate formats
* Find and replace function: to make all the subjects have same format
* IF function: to know the courses that are free or paid
* Vlookup: to know the top 20 most subscribed course.

A clean data will enable us carry out analysis that will make smarter business decisions based on facts, not instinct. It will also enable us win new students, make more revenues and reduce business risk.

**Microsoft Excel** was used for analysis because from its numerous functions, pivot tables and built-in analytic tools, it helps to analyze, visualize and gain insights from data.
**Tableau** being a data visualization tool that the business intelligence industry leverages on, was also used since it helps in sampling raw data in a very easy and understandable format.
